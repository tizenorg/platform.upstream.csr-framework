                             severity flags and client application behavior levels.

                             The scan functions set the TCS_SC_USER flag if the scanned object/data contains
                             malware harmful to the user. TCS_SC_TERMINAL flag is set if the malware is
                             harmful to the terminal itself. Both TCS_SC_USER and TCS_SC_TERMINAL flags are
                             set if the malware is harmful to both the user and the terminal.

                             The application behavior level specifies what to do with the data/object
                             containing the detected malware.

                             When multiple behavior level codes are found in a scanned data/object, the
                             calling application would be expected to act with the highest behavior level.
                             For example, if both TCS_BC_LEVEL0 and TCS_BC_LEVEL3 were reported, the application
                             would need to take on TCS_BC_LEVEL3 action. */

                                reported in pszFileName would be composed of multiple paths separated by the '|'

                                components of the path (the ones following the first). Only the first component,
                                if not empty, is the real file path of the currently scanned content. */
